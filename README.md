## Overview of OPA Speckle Patterns

This project presents various Optical Phased Array (OPA) speckle patterns generated by applying random voltages to the OPA. The corresponding source codes are located in the `OPA_Speckle_patterns` directory.

The comparative imaging results are implemented in the `oneD_OPA_plus_grating_scanning_imaging_optimize` folder.
