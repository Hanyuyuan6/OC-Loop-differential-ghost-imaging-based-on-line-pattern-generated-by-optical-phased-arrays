## Overview of OPA Speckle Patterns

This project presents various Optical Phased Array (OPA) speckle patterns generated by applying random voltages to the OPA. The corresponding source codes are located in the `OPA_Speckle_patterns` directory.

The figure below illustrates:

- (a) A schematic diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) OPA with a grating waveguide (GW) on a lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform;
- (b) Far-field intensity fluctuations along the X-axis direction;
- (c) Far-field intensity fluctuations along the Y-axis direction.

## Comparative Imaging Results

The comparative imaging results are implemented in the `oneD_OPA_plus_grating_scanning_imaging_optimize` folder. The simulation outcomes are summarized below:

- (a) Reconstructed images using Ghost Imaging (GI) at various sampling rates;
- (b) Reconstructed images using Differential Ghost Imaging (DGI);
- (c) Reconstructed images using Loop-Differential Ghost Imaging (LDGI);
- (d) Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) comparison;
- (e) Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) comparison;
- (f) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) comparison.
